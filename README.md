# My dotfiles

Hi everybody! This is my personal config of Emacs and Doom Emacs.

I'm currently use python and org mode a lot and that is what you will see on the config.

> Important! It has taken me a lot of time to get a decent python config for windows version of emacs. The autocompletion is missing and the performance is bad as well.
