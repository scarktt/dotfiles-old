# My dotfiles

Hi everybody! These are my personal configs of Emacs and Doom Emacs, neovim and powershell.

## Emacs and Doom Emacs (Without maintenance)

I'm currently use python and org mode a lot and that is what you will see on the config.

> Important! It has taken me a lot of time to get a decent python config for windows version of emacs. The autocompletion is missing and the performance is bad as well.

## Current Setup

My current setup (2022) include powershell and neovim running on Windows.

### Powershell

The resources that I have in my current powershell configuration, are mainly three.

**Powershell Modules**

[Terminal-Icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons)

[PSReadLine](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine)

**Fonts**

[Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font](https://en.m.fontke.com/font/64992431/download/)

### Neovim

I'm using doom-like key bindings for buffers and files... Feel free to customize the init.vim according to your personal preferences ;)
